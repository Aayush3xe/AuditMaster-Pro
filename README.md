QA-Streamline: Mobile-Responsive Quality Assurance App

QA-Streamline is a robust, mobile-responsive application built to modernize the inspection process. It empowers field inspectors with real-time scoring, seamless data synchronization, and a reliable offline-first architecture.

🚀 Key Features

* **Offline-First Capabilities:** Perform full inspections in remote areas without internet. Data is cached locally and syncs automatically once a connection is restored.
* **Real-Time Scoring:** Instant calculation of inspection grades based on customized weights and parameters.
* **Mobile-Responsive Design:** A fluid UI/UX optimized for smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
* **Seamless Data Sync:** Reliable background synchronization to ensure the back-office always has the latest field data.
* **Media Support:** Attach photos and notes directly to inspection points for high-accuracy reporting.

 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** [e.g., React Native, Flutter, or Next.js]
* **State Management:** [e.g., Redux, TanStack Query]
* **Local Storage:** [e.g., SQLite, Hive, or IndexedDB]
* **Backend:** [e.g., Node.js, Firebase, or Python/Django]
* **Database:** [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB]

 📸 Workflow Overview

1. **Inspection Setup:** Define parameters and scoring logic.
2. **Field Entry:** Inspectors capture data on-site (even offline).
3. **Automatic Sync:** Data is pushed to the central server when online.
4. **Analytics:** Management reviews real-time scores and trends.
